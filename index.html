            <h2>What is the Pythagorean Theorem?</h2>
            <p>The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
            <p class="math-equation">a² + b² = c²</p>

            <h2>Simple Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
            <p>One of the simplest proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem involves rearranging four identical right-angled triangles within a square. Here's how it works:</p>
            <div class="proof-visual">
                <div class="square" id="square1"></div>
                <div class="square" id="square2"></div>
            </div>
            <p>By rearranging the triangles, we can see that the area of the large square (c²) is equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares (a² + b²).</p>
